# 🔒 Security Implementation Guide

This guide documents the security enhancements implemented to address vulnerabilities identified in the security audit.

## 📋 Overview

The following critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed:

1. ✅ **Prompt Injection Sanitization** - Prevents malicious AI prompt manipulation
2. ✅ **Comprehensive Input Validation** - Validates all user inputs against defined rules
3. ✅ **API Authentication** - Secures endpoints with API key validation
4. ✅ **Rate Limiting** - Prevents abuse and API quota exhaustion

## 🛡️ Security Features

### 1. Prompt Injection Prevention

**Location:** `api/_lib/services/storyService.ts` (line 1189+)

**How it works:**
- Sanitizes user input using whitelist approach
- Removes special characters that could manipulate AI prompts
- Truncates input to maximum allowed length
- Validates semantic correctness (must contain alphanumeric characters)
- Implements rate limiting on failed sanitization attempts

**Example:**
```typescript
private sanitizeUserInput(input: string, userId?: string): string {
  if (!input) return '';
  
  // Whitelist: allow only letters, numbers, basic punctuation, and spaces
  const whitelistPattern = /[^a-zA-Z0-9 .,!?'"()-]/g;
  let sanitized = input.replace(whitelistPattern, '');
  
  // Ensure length limit
  sanitized = sanitized.slice(0, VALIDATION_RULES.userInput.maxLength);
  
  return sanitized.trim();
}
```

**Testing:**
- 5 comprehensive tests in `storyService.security.spec.ts`
- Tests cover: special characters, injection patterns, length limits, empty input, valid punctuation

### 2. Input Validation

**Location:** `api/_lib/services/storyService.ts` (line 1150+)

**Validates:**
- ✅ Creature type: Must be 'vampire', 'werewolf', or 'fairy'
- ✅ Themes: Must be array with 1-5 items
- ✅ Spicy level: Must be number between 1-5
- ✅ Word count: Must be number between 150-2000
- ✅ User input: Max 1000 characters

**Example:**
```typescript
private validateStoryInput(input: StoryGenerationSeam['input']): any {
  if (!input.creature || !['vampire', 'werewolf', 'fairy'].includes(input.creature)) {
    return {
      code: 'INVALID_INPUT',
      message: 'Invalid creature type',
      field: 'creature'
    };
  }
  // ... more validations
}
```

**Testing:**
- 10 comprehensive tests in `storyService.security.spec.ts`
- Tests cover: all field validations, type checking, boundary conditions

### 3. API Authentication

**Location:** `api/_lib/middleware/security.ts` (`authenticateRequest`, `checkRateLimit`), wired into every route through `api/_lib/middleware/apiAccessControl.ts` (`enforceApiAccessControl`).

**Features:**
- API key validation via X-API-Key header or Authorization Bearer token
- Environment variable configuration (`API_KEYS`)
- Development mode fallback (when no keys configured) — this checks whether
  any keys are configured *before* requiring the caller to have sent one, so
  a request with no key at all is allowed through when `API_KEYS` is unset,
  not just a request that happened to send some key anyway
- Per-key user ID mapping
- Wired into every route that spends money on the xAI/Grok API or handles a
  resource-costing request: `api/story/generate.ts`, `api/story/continue.ts`,
  `api/image/generate.ts`, `api/export/save.ts`, `api/story-lab/evaluate.ts`,
  `api/story-lab/stories.ts`, `api/story-lab/stories/[storyId]/continue.ts`,
  `api/story-lab/stream/genesis.ts`, and both handlers in
  `api/_lib/story-lab/jobs/jobRouteHandlers.ts` (job creation and the job
  event stream) — on both the Vercel serverless and the Node/Docker
  deployments, since both serve the same handler functions
  (`api/_lib/http/expressApiRoutes.ts`).
- The two routes a browser reaches through `EventSource`
  (`story-lab/stream/genesis`, `story-lab/jobs/:jobId/events`) also accept the
  key as an `apiKey` query parameter, since `EventSource` cannot set custom
  headers (`withEventStreamAuth` in `apiAccessControl.ts`).

**Setup:**

1. Set environment variable:
```bash
API_KEYS=key1,key2,key3
```

2. Call the shared guard at the start of a handler, right after its CORS and
   method checks and before it does any paid work:
```typescript
import { enforceApiAccessControl } from '../_lib/middleware/apiAccessControl';
import { RATE_LIMITS } from '../_lib/constants';

export default async function handler(req: any, res: any) {
  const access = await enforceApiAccessControl(req, res, 'story/generate', RATE_LIMITS.STORY_GENERATION);
  if (!access.allowed) {
    return; // enforceApiAccessControl has already written the 401 or 429 response
  }

  // ... rest of handler, using access.userId if needed
}
```

3. Client usage:
```typescript
// Option 1: X-API-Key header
fetch('/api/story/generate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(storyInput)
});

// Option 2: Authorization header
fetch('/api/story/generate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-api-key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(storyInput)
});
```

**Testing:**
- 6 comprehensive tests in `security.spec.ts`
- Tests cover: missing key, valid key, invalid key, development mode, both header types

### 4. Rate Limiting

**Location:** `api/_lib/middleware/security.ts` (`checkRateLimit`), applied through the same `enforceApiAccessControl` guard as authentication.

**Features:**
- Per-user, per-endpoint rate limiting
- Configurable limits and time windows
- In-memory storage (easily replaceable with Redis for production)
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries
- Returns remaining quota and reset time
- Applies even when `API_KEYS` is unset: every unauthenticated caller
  collapses onto the same `development_user` id, so `checkRateLimit` still
  gives them one *shared* budget per endpoint rather than unlimited access

**Setup:**

`enforceApiAccessControl` (see the Authentication section above) already
authenticates the request and checks its rate limit together, sets the
`X-RateLimit-Remaining` / `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers, and answers `429` when
the budget is spent — a handler does not call `checkRateLimit` directly.

Limits (from `api/_lib/constants.ts`):
```typescript
RATE_LIMITS = {
  STORY_GENERATION: { maxRequests: 10, windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000 },
  CHAPTER_CONTINUATION: { maxRequests: 10, windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000 },
  IMAGE_GENERATION: { maxRequests: 10, windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000 },
  EXPORT: { maxRequests: 20, windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000 },
  STREAMING: { maxRequests: 5, windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000 },
  STORY_LAB_GENESIS: { maxRequests: 10, windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000 },
  STORY_LAB_CONTINUATION: { maxRequests: 10, windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000 },
  STORY_LAB_JOB_CREATE: { maxRequests: 10, windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000 },
  STORY_LAB_EVALUATE: { maxRequests: 20, windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000 }
}
```

**Production Upgrade (Redis):**
```typescript
import Redis from 'ioredis';
const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

export async function checkRateLimitRedis(
  userId: string,
  endpoint: string,
  maxRequests: number,
  windowMs: number
) {
  const key = `ratelimit:${userId}:${endpoint}`;
  const count = await redis.incr(key);
  
  if (count === 1) {
    await redis.pexpire(key, windowMs);
  }
  
  return {
    allowed: count <= maxRequests,
    remaining: Math.max(0, maxRequests - count),
    resetTime: Date.now() + windowMs
  };
}
```

**Testing:**
- 7 comprehensive tests in `security.spec.ts`
- Tests cover: within limit, exceed limit, multiple users, multiple endpoints, time window reset

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set `API_KEYS` environment variable with secure keys — until this is set, every route stays in fail-open development mode (see the Notes below)
- [x] Test authentication with valid and invalid keys — `tests/api-key-auth.test.ts`, `tests/api-access-control.test.ts`
- [x] Test rate limiting with automated requests — `tests/api-access-control.test.ts`
- [ ] Update frontend to send an API key once `API_KEYS` is configured (it currently sends none, which relies on the fail-open path)
- [ ] Configure CORS to whitelist only production domains
- [ ] Consider upgrading rate limiting to Redis for distributed systems
- [ ] Monitor failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Set up alerts for rate limit violations
- [ ] Document API key management process for users

## 📊 Test Coverage

- `tests/api-key-auth.test.ts` — the primitives themselves: header parsing, casing, Bearer stripping, constant-time comparison, user id derivation, the fail-open path with and without a caller-supplied key
- `tests/api-access-control.test.ts` — every wired route: missing key → 401, wrong key → 401, valid key passes, rate limit exceeded → 429, the fail-open path with no `API_KEYS` configured, the shared rate-limit bucket that path still enforces, and the `EventSource` query-parameter fallback on the two streaming routes

## 🔍 Security Audit Status

| Vulnerability | Severity | Status |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| Prompt Injection | CRITICAL | ✅ Fixed |
| Input Validation | HIGH | ✅ Fixed |
| API Authentication | CRITICAL | ✅ Implemented and wired into every route |
| Rate Limiting | HIGH | ✅ Implemented and wired into every route |

## 📝 Notes

1. **Development Mode**: When `API_KEYS` is not set, authentication allows all requests for development convenience — this now applies to a request that sends no key at all, not only to one that happens to send some key anyway (the fix in this revision; see `authenticateRequest` in `security.ts`). Always set `API_KEYS` in production if you want the key check enforced.

2. **Rate Limiting Storage**: Current implementation uses in-memory storage suitable for single-instance deployments. For production with multiple instances, upgrade to Redis. It applies regardless of whether `API_KEYS` is set — an unconfigured deployment's unauthenticated callers still share one budget per endpoint.

3. **Input Sanitization**: Sanitization is applied at the service layer, providing defense-in-depth even if API handlers are bypassed.

4. **User Feedback**: Error messages are designed to be informative without leaking sensitive information about the system.

5. **The app's own frontend does not send an API key today.** Setting `API_KEYS` without also updating the frontend to send one would 401 every real user — see the checklist item above.
