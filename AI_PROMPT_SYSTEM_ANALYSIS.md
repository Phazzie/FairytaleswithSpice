```typescript
{
  model: 'grok-4-fast-reasoning',
  temperature: 0.8,              // Creativity level

## üìù CURRENT PROMPT COMPONENTS

### 1. SYSTEM PROMPT STRUCTURE

```
You are an audio-first dark-romance architect producing supernatural vignettes 
optimized for multi-voice narration.
```

**Grade**: A (95/100)

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Clear identity: "audio-first dark-romance architect"
- ‚úÖ Specific genre: "supernatural vignettes"
- ‚úÖ Technical requirement: "multi-voice narration"
- ‚úÖ End goal: "cliff-hook that guarantees listener return"

**Strengths**:
- Audio-optimization as primary constraint (unique!)
- Clear genre boundaries
- Goal-oriented (listener engagement)

**Could Improve**:

---

### 2. DYNAMIC STYLE SELECTION

**How It Works**:
```typescript
selectRandomAuthorStyles(creature: string) {
  // 2+1 Selection Pattern:
  // - 2 authors matching creature type (vampire/werewolf/fairy)
  // - 1 author from different creature type (for variety)
  // Fisher-Yates shuffle for true randomness
}
```

**Author Banks**:
- **Vampire**: Jeaniene Frost, J.R. Ward, Christine Feehan, Anne Rice, Kresley Cole (5 total)
- **Werewolf**: Patricia Briggs, Ilona Andrews, Nalini Singh, Kelley Armstrong, Jennifer Ashley (5 total)
- **Fairy**: Holly Black, Sarah J. Maas, Melissa Marr, Grace Draven, Julie Kagawa (5 total)

**Grade**: A+ (97/100)

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Each author has: voice sample + trait description
- ‚úÖ Diverse styles within each creature type
- ‚úÖ 2+1 pattern ensures variety while maintaining genre coherence
- ‚úÖ Fisher-Yates shuffle prevents selection bias

**Example Output**:
```
DYNAMIC STYLE SELECTION FOR THIS STORY:
Jeaniene Frost: "You know what I like about you?" His smile was all sharp edges. 
"Absolutely nothing. That's what makes you interesting." | Razor-sharp wit that cuts before you feel the blade

Anne Rice: "Do you know what it means to love something for centuries?..." | 
Philosophical torment wrapped in beauty

Ilona Andrews: "Great. Magical politics, ancient curses, and now this..." | 
Urban grit balanced with unexpected humor
```

**Strengths**:
- Prevents AI from falling into single style rut
- Teaches through example (show, don't tell)
- Blends genre conventions with cross-pollination
- Each generation feels unique

**Could Improve**:
- Add 2-3 more authors per creature type (expand to 7-8 each)
- Include male/diverse authors (currently female-heavy)
- Add intensity indicators (slow-burn vs fast-paced)

- **Vampire**: Laurell K. Hamilton (action-heavy), Charlaine Harris (cozy-dark blend)
- **Werewolf**: Carrie Vaughn (introspective), Shelly Laurenston (comedic)
- **Fairy**: Seanan McGuire (dark whimsy), Karen Marie Moning (epic scale)

## üéØ FINAL ASSESSMENT

### **What's Working Incredibly Well**:
1. Audio-first optimization (unique positioning)
2. Dynamic author style selection (prevents repetition)
3. Voice metadata system (zero-cost quality boost)

2. Expanded author library (7-8 per creature)
