## üéØ CURRENT PROMPT ARCHITECTURE

### 1. SYSTEM PROMPT STRUCTURE

```typescript
buildSystemPrompt(input: StoryGenerationSeam['input']): string {
  // Get random author style selections for this generation
  const selectedStyles = this.selectRandomAuthorStyles(input.creature);
  const selectedBeatStructure = this.getRandomBeatStructure(input);
  
  return `You are an audio-first dark-romance architect producing supernatural vignettes 
optimized for multi-voice narration. Your sole purpose is to fabricate episodes that sound 
cinematic when read aloud and end on a cliff-hook that guarantees listener return.

DYNAMIC STYLE SELECTION FOR THIS STORY:
${selectedStyles.map(style => `${style.author}: "${style.voiceSample}" | ${style.trait}`).join('\n')}

${selectedBeatStructure}

[... rest of prompt ...]`;
}
```

**Grade**: A (92/100)

**Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ Clear role definition ("audio-first dark-romance architect")
- ‚úÖ Specific purpose statement
- ‚úÖ Dynamic randomization for variety
- ‚úÖ Audio-optimized focus

**Weaknesses**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could specify more about emotional beats
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No guidance on sensory layering
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing micro-tension techniques

---

## üìñ COMPONENT 1: DYNAMIC AUTHOR STYLE SELECTION

### How It Works:

```typescript
selectRandomAuthorStyles(creature: string): Array<{author: string, voiceSample: string, trait: string}> {
  // Selection algorithm: 2+1 hybrid
  // - 2 authors matching the creature type
  // - 1 author from different creature type (cross-pollination)
  
  const vampireStyles = [
    { author: 'Jeaniene Frost', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Razor-sharp wit that cuts before you feel the blade' },
    { author: 'J.R. Ward', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Brooding protectiveness bordering on obsession' },
    { author: 'Christine Feehan', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Gothic atmosphere thick enough to taste' },
    { author: 'Anne Rice', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Philosophical torment wrapped in beauty' },
    { author: 'Kresley Cole', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Wild, reckless passion defying all logic' }
  ];
  
  const werewolfStyles = [
    { author: 'Patricia Briggs', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Grounded pragmatism with fierce loyalty' },
    { author: 'Ilona Andrews', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Urban grit balanced with unexpected humor' },
    { author: 'Nalini Singh', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Primal sensuality overwhelming rational thought' },
    { author: 'Kelley Armstrong', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Suspenseful tension building like a storm' },
    { author: 'Jennifer Ashley', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Found family bonds stronger than blood' }
  ];
  
  const fairyStyles = [
    { author: 'Holly Black', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Court intrigue where every smile hides daggers' },
    { author: 'Sarah J. Maas', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Epic romance with world-shattering consequences' },
    { author: 'Melissa Marr', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Dangerous beauty drawing moths to flame' },
    { author: 'Grace Draven', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Slow-burn intimacy across cultural impossibilities' },
    { author: 'Julie Kagawa', voiceSample: '...', trait: 'Honor versus desire in heart-wrenching choices' }
  ];
  
  // Fisher-Yates shuffle for uniform distribution
  // Select 2 from matching creature + 1 from different creatures
}
```

### Example Output:

**For Vampire Story:**
```
DYNAMIC STYLE SELECTION FOR THIS STORY:
J.R. Ward: "The male's voice was rough as granite. 'Touch her again, and I'll show you what eternity really means.'" | Brooding protectiveness bordering on obsession
Anne Rice: "Do you know what it means to love something for centuries? To watch it change, to watch it die, to watch it become something you no longer recognize?" | Philosophical torment wrapped in beauty
Nalini Singh: "His wolf pressed against his skin, demanding he claim what was his, mark her, make her understand she belonged to the pack‚Äîto him." | Primal sensuality overwhelming rational thought
```

### Analysis:

**Grade**: A+ (96/100)

**Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ **15 curated authors** (5 per creature type)
- ‚úÖ **Voice samples** show, don't tell writing style
- ‚úÖ **Trait summaries** distill the essence
- ‚úÖ **2+1 hybrid selection** prevents homogeneity
- ‚úÖ **Fisher-Yates shuffle** ensures fair randomization
- ‚úÖ **Cross-pollination** (vampire story can get werewolf author for variety)

**Weaknesses**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only 15 authors total (could expand to 30+)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No weighting based on theme/spice level
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could include more diverse sub-genres

**Improvement Suggestions**:
1. Add 5 more authors per creature (30 total)
2. Add author "specialties" (mystery, comedy, dark, etc.)
3. Weight selection based on user's theme choices
4. Include indie/lesser-known authors for variety

## üéÅ COMPONENT 3: CHEKHOV'S GUN ELEMENTS

### How It Works:

```typescript
generateChekovElements(): string {
  const elements = [
    "Ancient artifact with hidden power",
    "Mysterious scar with forgotten origin", 
    "Locked room that calls to the protagonist",
    "Stranger who knows too much about the past",
    "Inherited item with supernatural properties",
    "Recurring dream that feels like memory",

  ];

  // Select 2 random elements
  const shuffled = elements.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random());
  const selected = shuffled.slice(0, 2);
  
  return `[Chekhov1]: ${selected[0]}
[Chekhov2]: ${selected[1]}
(These elements should be planted naturally and will pay off in future chapters)`;
}

## üö´ COMPONENT 4: PROSE ENGINE (BANNED WORDS)

### Current Implementation:

```
PROSE ENGINE (MANDATORY):
BANNED WORDS/PHRASES (hard-fail unless inside dialogue for character voice):
"suddenly", "very", "she felt", "he felt", "it was [emotion]", 
"he was [adj]", "she was [adj]", "there was", "began to", "started to"

NO PURPLE PROSE / NO FILLER:
Every line must move plot, reveal character, or raise tension.
Vary sentence length for audio rhythm. Keep paragraphs 1-4 lines.
```

### Analysis:

**Grade**: A (93/100)

**Banned Words List**: 10 phrases

**Strengths**:

- ‚úÖ **Removes filler** ("very", "suddenly")
- ‚úÖ **Allows exceptions** for dialogue (realistic character voice)
- ‚úÖ **Clear "no purple prose" directive**

**Weaknesses**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could expand to 20 banned phrases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No positive examples of what to use INSTEAD
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing common weak words ("just", "really", "quite")

**Additional Banned Words to Consider**:
1. "really", "quite", "rather", "somewhat"
2. "thing", "stuff", "something"
3. "nice", "good", "bad" (too vague)
4. "look", "seemed", "appeared" (weak observation verbs)
5. "that" (often unnecessary)
6. Adverbs ending in "-ly" (usually lazy writing)
7. "wondered", "thought", "realized" (telling internal state)
8. "decided to", "tried to", "managed to"
9. "could feel", "could see", "could hear"
10. "make", "get", "have" (weak action verbs)

**Improvement Suggestions**:
```
BANNED WORDS EXPANDED (20 phrases):
GROUP 1 - WEAK VERBS:
"suddenly", "began to", "started to", "tried to", "managed to", "decided to"

GROUP 2 - TELLING NOT SHOWING:
"she felt", "he felt", "it was [emotion]", "he was [adj]", "she was [adj]"

GROUP 3 - FILLER/HEDGING:
"very", "really", "quite", "rather", "somewhat", "just"

GROUP 4 - VAGUE WORDS:
"thing", "stuff", "nice", "good", "bad"

INSTEAD USE:
- Strong, specific verbs (lunged, traced, shattered, whispered)
- Concrete sensory details (pulse throbbed, candlelight flickered)
- Action that implies emotion (fingers trembled vs "she felt nervous")
```

## üéØ COMPONENT 6: CHARACTER MANDATE

### Current Implementation:

```
CHARACTER MANDATE:
Core Desire Template: "[Narrator]: <Name> wants <X> because <Y> but <Z>."
Every protagonist needs: driving WANT (revenge, freedom, power), visible flaws, emotional vulnerability shown through action.
Distinct dialogue patterns: sentence length, formality, emotional triggers.
```

### Analysis:

**Grade**: B+ (86/100)

**Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ **Core desire template** (Want-Because-But structure)
- ‚úÖ **Lists essential elements** (want, flaws, vulnerability)
- ‚úÖ **Notes dialogue distinction** requirement

**Weaknesses**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Template not demonstrated with example
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Visible flaws" too vague
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Dialogue patterns" mentioned but not specified
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No guidance on character arc within short format

**Improvement Suggestions**:

```
CHARACTER MANDATE (ENHANCED):

CORE DESIRE TEMPLATE (use in opening 100 words):
"[Narrator]: <Name> wants <X> because <Y> but <Z>."

EXAMPLES:
"[Narrator]: Damien wants mortality because immortality has become a prison, but taking it would cost the lives of everyone he's spent centuries protecting."

"[Narrator]: Elena wants to break her family's curse because her sister has one month left, but the only person who can help her is the vampire who murdered her parents."

REQUIRED CHARACTER LAYERS:

1. EXTERNAL WANT (what they say they want)
2. INTERNAL NEED (what they actually need)
3. VISIBLE FLAW (shown through action):
   - Reckless: Jumps before looking
   - Controlling: Must plan everything
   - Closed-off: Deflects with humor/sarcasm
   - Self-sacrificing: Puts others first to a fault
   - Proud: Won't ask for help even when desperate

4. EMOTIONAL VULNERABILITY (ONE moment of raw honesty):
   - Confession of fear
   - Admission of loneliness
   - Breakdown of facade
   - Genuine laugh after trauma
   - Tears held back for too long

5. DIALOGUE VOICE (pick 2-3):
   - Sentence length: Terse / Moderate / Verbose
   - Formality: Crude / Casual / Neutral / Formal / Archaic
   - Emotional expression: Repressed / Sardonic / Direct / Dramatic
   - Speech pattern: Interrupts self / Trails off / Uses full sentences / Contracts
```

---

## ‚ù§Ô∏è COMPONENT 7: CONSENT & CHEMISTRY BLOCK

### Current Implementation:

```
CONSENT & CHEMISTRY BLOCK:
INTIMATE SCENES MUST:
- Show enthusiastic consent through action/dialogue ("Yes," "Please," "Don't stop")
- Build emotional connection alongside physical escalation
- Use anticipation and denial to heighten tension
- Never rush to physical without emotional stakes
```

### Analysis:

**Grade**: A+ (97/100)

**Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ **Enthusiastic consent required**
- ‚úÖ **Specific examples** of consent language
- ‚úÖ **Emotional connection emphasized**
- ‚úÖ **Pacing guidance** (anticipation and denial)
- ‚úÖ **Stakes requirement**

**Weaknesses**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could specify non-verbal consent cues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could add "check-in" dialogue examples

**Minor Enhancement**:

```
CONSENT & CHEMISTRY (ENHANCED):

CONSENT MUST BE:
1. ENTHUSIASTIC (not just "okay" or silence)
   - Verbal: "Yes," "Please," "Don't stop," "More," "I want this"
   - Non-verbal: Pulling closer, initiating, meeting halfway

2. ONGOING (check-ins mid-scene)
   - "[Character A]: 'Still good?' [Character B]: 'So good.'"
   - "[Narrator]: Her eyes met his, asking. He nodded, breathless."

3. REVOCABLE (can stop anytime)
   - "[Character A]: 'Wait‚Äî' [Narrator]: He stopped. Instantly."

CHEMISTRY BUILDING:
- Start with TENSION (proximity, eye contact, accidental touch)
- Build to AWARENESS (noticing details, hypervigilance)
- Progress to ANTICIPATION (almost moments, interrupted touches)
- Escalate to ACTION (first kiss, first touch)
- Include EMOTIONAL STAKES (why THIS person matters)

NEVER:
- Dubious consent scenarios
- Physical without emotional build
- Rush from 0 to intimate in one paragraph
```

---

## üå∂Ô∏è COMPONENT 8: SPICE LEVEL CALIBRATION

### Current Implementation:

```
SPICE LEVELS (match exactly):
Level 1: Yearning looks, accidental touches, sweet anticipation
Level 2: First kisses, heated arguments, sensual tension
Level 3: Clothes stay on, hands don't, steamy fade-to-black
Level 4: Explicit but emotional, detailed physical intimacy
Level 5: Nothing left to imagination, graphic yet sophisticated
```

### Analysis:

**Grade**: A+ (98/100)

**Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ **Clear 5-level spectrum**
- ‚úÖ **Specific boundaries** for each level
- ‚úÖ **Progressive escalation**
- ‚úÖ **Emotional requirement** even at high levels ("explicit but emotional")
- ‚úÖ **Sophistication requirement** (not crude)

**Weaknesses**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could provide 2-3 examples per level
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Fade-to-black" timing not specified

**Minor Enhancement**:

```
SPICE LEVELS (WITH EXAMPLES):

LEVEL 1: SWEET ANTICIPATION
- What to include: Yearning looks, accidental touches, lingering eye contact
- Example: "[Narrator]: His hand brushed hers reaching for the same book. Neither pulled away."

LEVEL 2: SENSUAL TENSION
- What to include: First kisses, heated arguments, intentional proximity
- Example: "[Narrator]: The kiss was brief. Devastating. Left her wanting everything he wasn't giving."

LEVEL 3: STEAMY FADE-TO-BLACK
- What to include: Clothes stay on, hands explore, kiss leads to bed
- Fade timing: Right before clothing removal
- Example: "[Narrator]: His hands traced her curves through silk. 'Bedroom?' she whispered. He nodded, lifting her‚Äî" [FADE]

LEVEL 4: EXPLICIT BUT EMOTIONAL
- What to include: Detailed physical intimacy, specific body parts, emotional connection
- Example: "[Narrator]: He entered her slowly, eyes locked, watching every flicker of pleasure cross her face. 'You feel like home,' he whispered."

LEVEL 5: GRAPHIC YET SOPHISTICATED
- What to include: Nothing left to imagination, explicit language, raw intensity
- Maintain: Emotional stakes, sophisticated prose (not crude)
- Example: "[Narrator]: She rode him with abandon, taking what she needed, giving everything she had. Their sounds‚Äîhis growls, her gasps‚Äîechoed off stone walls older than memory."
```

## üé¨ COMPONENT 9: MORAL DILEMMA TRIGGER

### Current Implementation:

```
MORAL DILEMMA TRIGGER:
At midpoint (‚âà50% word count), protagonist faces desire-vs-principle choice that drives the remainder and influences the cliffhanger.
```

### Analysis:

**Grade**: B (83/100)

**Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ **Specific placement** (midpoint)
- ‚úÖ **Clear framework** (desire vs principle)
- ‚úÖ **Story impact** (drives remainder + cliffhanger)

**Weaknesses**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No examples provided
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Too vague about what qualifies as "moral dilemma"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't specify how to show the internal conflict

**Improvement Suggestions**:

```
MORAL DILEMMA TRIGGER (ENHANCED):

PLACEMENT: Midpoint (‚âà50% word count)

STRUCTURE: Desire vs Principle
- DESIRE: What the character wants (love, power, freedom, revenge)
- PRINCIPLE: What they believe is right (loyalty, honor, duty, truth)
- STAKES: Choosing one means losing the other

DILEMMA TYPES:

1. LOYALTY VS LOVE
   Example: "[Character]: To save him, I'd have to betray my family. To honor my family, I'd have to let him die."

2. TRUTH VS SAFETY
   Example: "[Character]: Revealing the secret would free us both. It would also destroy three kingdoms."

3. POWER VS MORALITY
   Example: "[Character]: The ritual requires a sacrifice. It always requires a sacrifice. She volunteered. That doesn't make it right."

4. DUTY VS DESIRE
   Example: "[Character]: The pack needs an alpha. He needs a partner. I can't be both."

5. REVENGE VS REDEMPTION
   Example: "[Character]: Twenty years I've planned this. Now, looking at him, I see my father's eyes. Killing him won't bring Dad back. But letting him live dishonors everything."

HOW TO SHOW:
- Internal monologue (brief, raw)
- Physical manifestation (hands shaking, can't breathe)
- Dialogue with another character (arguing both sides)
- Action that shows conflict (reaching for X, pulling back, reaching again)

RESOLUTION TIMING:
- Present dilemma at 50%
- Character struggles 50-75%
- Choice made at 75-90%
- Consequences at 90-100% (cliffhanger)
```

   Examples:
   - "[Narrator]: The symbol on the wall matched the one in her dreams. The one she'd never told anyone about."
   - "[Character A]: 'How do you know my real name?' [Character B]: 'Lucky guess.' [Narrator]: It wasn't."

## üöÄ TOP 10 NEW COMPONENTS TO ADD

### 1. **SENSORY LAYERING SYSTEM** (HIGH PRIORITY)

```typescript
SENSORY IMMERSION (MANDATORY):
Every scene must engage AT LEAST 3 of the 5 senses:

SIGHT: Not "dark room" ‚Üí "Candlelight flickered across stone walls, shadows pooling like spilled ink"
SOUND: Not "quiet" ‚Üí "The only sound: her pulse, thundering loud enough to wake the dead"
SMELL: Not "perfume" ‚Üí "Jasmine and something darker‚Äîleather, old books, forbidden promises"
TASTE: Not "wine" ‚Üí "The vintage burned her throat, rich and copper-sweet, like drinking liquid velvet"
TOUCH: Not "soft skin" ‚Üí "His fingertips traced her collarbone, feather-light, raising goosebumps"

SENSORY STACKING:
Every paragraph = minimum 2 senses
Key scenes = all 5 senses
Opening paragraph = 3+ senses (immediate immersion)

EXAMPLE:
‚ùå BAD: "The room was romantic."
‚úÖ GOOD: "[Narrator]: Rose petals crushed beneath her heels, releasing their perfume. Candlelight danced across his face, casting shadows that made his smile wicked. The air tasted thick, heavy with unspoken promises."
```

**Expected Impact**: +15% reader immersion, +20% emotional engagement

---

### 2. **MICRO-TENSION TOOLKIT** (HIGH PRIORITY)

```typescript
MICRO-TENSION (apply every 50-100 words):

TECHNIQUE 1: INTERRUPTED MOMENTS
"His lips were inches from hers when the door slammed open‚Äî"

TECHNIQUE 2: CONTRADICTORY ACTIONS
"She told herself to leave. Her feet stayed rooted."

TECHNIQUE 3: SENSORY CONFLICT
"Every instinct screamed danger. She stepped closer anyway."

TECHNIQUE 4: LOADED SILENCE
"The silence stretched between them, crackling with everything they weren't saying."

TECHNIQUE 5: PROXIMITY + RESTRAINT
"He stood close enough to touch. Didn't."

TECHNIQUE 6: INTERNAL VS EXTERNAL
"[Character]: 'I don't want you here.' [Narrator]: Her pulse said otherwise."

TECHNIQUE 7: POWER SHIFTS
"She pinned him with a look that could melt steel. He smiled."

APPLY: At least 1 micro-tension moment every paragraph
Never let tension plateau for more than 100 words
```

**Expected Impact**: +25% reader engagement, +40% "can't put it down" factor

---

### 3. **DIALOGUE SUBTEXT MASTERY** (HIGH PRIORITY)

```typescript
DIALOGUE SUBTEXT:

RULE 1: CHARACTERS LIE (especially to themselves)
Surface: "I'm not attracted to you."
Subtext: (Shows up at 2am anyway)

RULE 2: POWER PLAYS IN EVERY LINE
‚ùå "Can I see you tonight?" (weak)
‚úÖ "I'll be at the club. You'll come." (power)
‚úÖ "Will you be there?" "Would it matter if I said no?" (reversal)

RULE 3: EMOTIONAL DODGE BALL
Character A reveals ‚Üí Character B deflects/pivots/attacks
"Do you feel this too?" "Feel what? Your breath on my neck? Your eyes undressing me?"

RULE 4: DOUBLE MEANINGS
"I want to know what makes you tick."
(Innocent curiosity OR seductive threat? Both.)

EVERY LINE SHOULD:
- Reveal character
- Advance plot OR tension
- Mean more than it says

EXAMPLE:
‚ùå BAD: "I like you." "I like you too."
‚úÖ GOOD:
[Character A]: "You're dangerous."
[Character B]: "Only to people who bore me."
[Character A]: "Then I should try harder to be dull."
[Character B]: "Too late for that."
```

**Expected Impact**: +30% dialogue quality, +20% character depth

ACTION/TENSION SCENES:
- SHORT. PUNCHY. SENTENCES.
- 3-8 words max
- Visceral verbs

EXAMPLE: "[Narrator]: He moved. She blocked. Steel kissed steel. Sparks flew. Their eyes locked."

INTIMATE SCENES:
- Mix of both
- Start slow ‚Üí accelerate ‚Üí pause ‚Üí accelerate

EXAMPLE: "[Narrator]: His thumb traced her lower lip. Slowly. Deliberately. Then‚Äî [Character]: 'Please.' [Narrator]: ‚Äîhe kissed her like drowning."

VARY PACING EVERY 100-150 WORDS
Never same rhythm twice in a row
```

"The curse isn't the problem. The problem is I'm starting to *want* the binding."

50% MIDPOINT: STAKES INVERSION
"Breaking the curse will kill him. And I just realized I'd rather die than lose him."

50-75% LATE MIDDLE: IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE
"Save him = betray family. Save family = watch him die. No third option."

75-90% CLIMAX: EXISTENTIAL STAKES
"This choice doesn't just affect tonight. It defines who I am forever."

90-100% CLIFFHANGER: RAISE STAKES AGAIN
"She made her choice. Then the door opened, and she saw who'd been watching‚Äî"

RULES:
- Each stage RAISES stakes
- Stakes must be SPECIFIC
- Tie to character's deepest fear/desire
```

**Expected Impact**: +25% dramatic impact, +30% emotional investment
