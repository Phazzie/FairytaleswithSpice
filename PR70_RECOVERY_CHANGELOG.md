# PR #70 Recovery Changelog

This is the chronological work log for the PR #70 recovery. It should capture commands, decisions, self-review notes, validation results, and anything that changes the plan.

## 2026-05-26 00:12 EDT - Recovery Tracking Started

Actions:

- Rewrote `AGENTS.md` as the first execution step after the user asked for it.
- Corrected the agent guidance from DigitalOcean-only to Vercel-first.
- Added an explicit pointer from `AGENTS.md` to `PR70_RECOVERY_PLAN.md`.
- Added instructions for keeping this changelog, `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`, `PR70_RECOVERY_LEDGER.md`, and `NOT_TAKEN_FEATURE_LEDGER.md` current.

Observations:

- The repo still contains conflicting architecture signals:
  - `vercel.json` and `api/_lib/*` support Vercel.
  - `.do/app.yaml`, `.do/app.yaml.buildpack`, and several docs still point at DigitalOcean.
  - Older PRs use `api/lib/*` or `story-generator/src/api/lib/*`.
- Audio is still present in some current files and many stale PRs, but the current recovery scope keeps audio deferred.

Self-review:

- The first requested action was completed before branch or merge work.
- The next required safety step is to preserve local state before creating the recovery branch.
- Current dirty state still includes lockfile changes from earlier install work and untracked recovery docs.

## 2026-05-26 00:12 EDT - Recovery Branch Created

Actions:

- Refreshed `origin` with `git fetch origin`.
- Tried to create the planned branch name `recovery/pr70-story-lab-vercel`; Git could not create the nested ref path in this checkout.
- Created the flat branch `recovery-pr70-story-lab-vercel` instead.

Decision:

- Use `recovery-pr70-story-lab-vercel` as the actual recovery branch name.
- Keep the plan's intent unchanged: this is the branch where PR #70 becomes the baseline and other open PRs are merged, ported, mined, or closed.

Open issue:

- `git stash push` for the lockfile noise returned exit code 1 without output. The lockfile changes remain uncommitted and visible.
