## 🎯 Development Methodology

**Seam-Driven Development**: Prevents integration failures by defining all data boundaries with TypeScript contracts before implementation.

### Core Principles
1. **UI-First**: Build complete working interface with mock data
2. **Contracts Define Everything**: Explicit TypeScript interfaces for all seams
3. **Regenerate Don't Debug**: Fix contracts and regenerate code
4. **One Complete Thing**: Build fully working features incrementally

## 🔗 Integration Status

### External Services
- ✅ **Grok AI**: Story and chapter generation
- ✅ **ElevenLabs**: Text-to-speech conversion
- ✅ **Vercel**: Deployment and hosting

### Development Features
- ✅ **Mock Services**: Complete functionality without API keys
- ✅ **Hot Reload**: Instant development feedback
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Compile-time error prevention
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive validation suite

## 🤝 Contributing

This project uses **Seam-Driven Development**. Before implementing features:
1. Review existing contracts in `contracts.ts`
2. Define new seams with TypeScript interfaces
3. Build UI with mock data first
4. Implement backend services to contracts
5. Replace mocks with real API integration

See `AGENTS.md` for comprehensive development guidelines.
