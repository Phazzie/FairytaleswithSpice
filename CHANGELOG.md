## [2.2.0] - 2025-01-XX

### üöÄ Digital Ocean Migration

#### Zero Technical Debt Migration
- **Express Server Integration**: Added API routes to existing SSR server (no adapter pattern, no abstraction layer)
- **Service Layer Preservation**: All seam contracts remain unchanged in `api/lib/services/` (seam-driven compliance)
- **Direct Route Implementation**: Copy-pasted serverless function logic into Express routes (5 endpoints: health, generate, continue, audio, export)
- **Buildpack Deployment**: Digital Ocean auto-detection (no Dockerfile needed)

#### Changed Files (3 total, ~180 lines)
- `story-generator/src/server.ts`: Added middleware (JSON, CORS) + 5 API routes (142 lines added)
- `story-generator/package.json`: Added `build:prod`, `start:prod` scripts + Node 20 engine requirement (3 lines added)
- `.do/app.yaml`: Digital Ocean App Platform configuration (buildpack, health checks, environment variables) (new file, 47 lines)

#### Deployment Details
- **Method**: Digital Ocean App Platform with Node.js buildpack
- **Build**: `cd story-generator && npm install && npm run build:prod`
- **Runtime**: `cd story-generator && npm run start:prod`
- **Port**: 8080 (configurable via PORT env var)
- **Cost**: $5/month (basic-xxs tier)
- **Region**: NYC (configurable to SFO, AMS, etc.)

#### Technical Approach
- **Seam-Driven Compliance**: Service layer untouched, only HTTP transport changed (Vercel functions ‚Üí Express routes)
- **Mock Fallbacks**: Development mode works without API keys
- **Zero Refactoring**: Direct code copy-paste, no architectural changes
- **Simple Migration**: ~150 lines of actual code changes

### üîß Technical Debt Status
**Created**: 0 new items  
**Deferred**: Root package.json TypeScript dependency (non-critical, scale-only issue)  
**Maintained**: All existing seam contracts and service layer architecture
