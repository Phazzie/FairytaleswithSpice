## Why These Were Archived

These documents represent important historical context for the project's development but are no longer current:

1. **Feature-Specific Documentation**: Documents like the Enhanced Story Generation roadmap and changelog were specific to a single major feature implementation and are now superseded by the main CHANGELOG.md.

2. **Development Process Documentation**: PR descriptions and merge summaries are valuable for understanding the development process but don't belong in the main project documentation.

3. **Investigation Documents**: Technical investigations and analyses provide important context but are not needed for ongoing development or user documentation.

## Current Documentation

For current project documentation, refer to:
- **README.md** - Main project overview and setup
- **AGENTS.md** - AI development workflow guide  
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Complete project changelog
- **api/README.md** - API documentation
