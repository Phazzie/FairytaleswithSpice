Do not delete or commit these automatically. Triage them as a separate task.

## Last Verified Checks

Run from `/Users/hbpheonix/fairytaleswithspice` on 2026-06-08:

- `scripts/recovery/check-vercel-function-count.sh`
  - Passed: `10/12`, within limit.
- `scripts/recovery/preflight.sh --quick --skip-status`
  - Passed.
- `npm run test:all`
  - Passed.
  - Caveat: tests ran in mock mode because `XAI_API_KEY` was not present.
  - Caveat: mock generation produced large word-count variance while still passing.

## What Changed In This Handoff Slice

Added the documentation package for app audit and autonomous overnight work:

- `STORY_LAB_APP_AUDIT.md`
- `OVERNIGHT_MODE.md`
- `STORY_LAB_IDEA_BOARD.md`
- `OVERNIGHT_HANDOFF.md`

Updated repo guidance:

- `AGENTS.md` now points future agents to the audit, overnight mode, idea board, and handoff docs.
- `AGENTS.md` was audited and revised so PR70 recovery is no longer the default task path for platform/auth/storage/profile/overnight work.
- `AGENTS.md` now requires live repo state, `STORY_LAB_APP_AUDIT.md`, and the matching execution plan before planning, editing, or claiming readiness.

## Current Top Risks

1. Auth/profile/cloud save are not user features yet.
2. Story Lab jobs are still non-durable and process-local.
3. Live provider output is not proven without credentials.
4. Vercel function budget is usable but tight at `10/12`.
5. Mock story length is far below requested targets while tests still pass.
6. Untracked files need deliberate triage.

## Next Best Autonomous Tasks

1. Reconcile stale progress language in `STORY_LAB_STORAGE_PORT_EXEC_PLAN.md`.
2. Create a concrete auth/profile/cloud-library implementation plan.
3. Triage `SPARK_TRIAL_TASKS.md`, `STORY_QUALITY_EVALS_PLAN.md`, and `tests/grok-smoke.test.ts`.
4. Run one source-backed research-mining pass and update `STORY_LAB_IDEA_BOARD.md`.
5. Pick one small story-quality or Weird Lab experiment and implement it with focused tests.

### 2026-06-08 07:01 EDT

Branch:

- `main`

Commit:

- Pending; this slice is not committed yet.

User request:

- Begin overnight work after building the audit and overnight-mode docs.

Work completed:

- Reconciled `STORY_LAB_STORAGE_PORT_EXEC_PLAN.md` against current `main`.
- Marked the storage-port PR/review/merge step complete based on PR #102 / merge commit `4d21e4f`.
- Updated the plan so it no longer reads like cloud account sync is part of the completed Phase C scaffold.
- Recorded that current route count is `10/12`, while the old `12/12` references are historical.
- Added the next required work: create an auth/profile/cloud-library implementation plan before wiring storage into user-visible cloud sync.

Files changed:

- `STORY_LAB_STORAGE_PORT_EXEC_PLAN.md`
- `OVERNIGHT_HANDOFF.md`

Checks run:

- `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,url` -> no open PRs.
- `scripts/recovery/check-vercel-function-count.sh` -> `10/12`, within limit.
- `npx tsx tests/story-lab-storage-port.test.ts` -> passed.
- `npx tsx tests/story-lab-auth.test.ts` -> passed.
- `npm run test:story-lab-state` -> passed.
- `scripts/recovery/preflight.sh --quick --skip-status` -> passed.

Checks skipped:

- Full `npm run test:all`; this was a docs/plan reconciliation slice and focused storage/auth/state checks covered the touched plan claims.

Known issues:

- Auth provider integration, user profiles, cloud project library UI, durable database provisioning, storage routes, and signed-in cloud sync remain unimplemented.
- Existing untracked files still need triage: `SPARK_TRIAL_TASKS.md`, `STORY_QUALITY_EVALS_PLAN.md`, `tests/grok-smoke.test.ts`.

Next recommended task:

- Create a concrete auth/profile/cloud-library implementation plan, or triage the three untracked files if staying purely local.
